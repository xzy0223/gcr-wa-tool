Amazon S3 Bucket Versioning,"Description: Checks for Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets that do not have versioning enabled, or have versioning suspended. When versioning is enabled, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore any version of any object stored in a bucket. You can use lifecycle rules to manage all versions of your objects as well as their associated costs by automatically archiving objects to the Glacier storage class or removing them after a specified time period. You can also choose to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for any object deletions or configuration changes to your buckets. 

Versioning cannot be disabled after it has been enabled, but it can be suspended, which prevents new versions of objects from being created. Using versioning can increase your costs for Amazon S3, because you pay for storage of multiple versions of an object.

Alert Criteria
Green: Versioning is enabled for the bucket.
Yellow: Versioning is not enabled for the bucket.
Yellow: Versioning is suspended for the bucket.

Recommended Action
Enable bucket versioning on most buckets to prevent accidental deletion or overwriting. See Using Versioning and Enabling Versioning Programmatically.

Amazon RDS ReplicaLag,"Description: Checks to see if the ReplicaLag CloudWatch metric for an RDS database instance has increased above an operationally reasonable threshold over the past day.ReplicaLag metric measures the number of seconds a read replica is behind the primary instance. Replication lag occurs when the asynchronous updates made to the read replica cannot keep up with the updates happening on the primary database instance. In the event of a failure to the primary instance, data could be missing from the read replica if the ReplicaLag is above an operationally reasonable threshold.

Alert Criteria
Red: ReplicaLag metric exceeded 60 seconds at least once during the week.
Yellow: ReplicaLag metric exceeded 10 seconds at least once during the week.
Green: ReplicaLag is less than 10 seconds.

Recommended Action
There are several possible causes for ReplicaLag to increase beyond operationally safe levels.  For example, it can be caused by recently replaced/launched replica instances from older backups and these replicas requiring substantial time to catch-up to the primary database instance and live transactions. This ReplicaLag may dwindle over time as catch-up occurs. Another example could be that the transaction velocity able to be achieved on the primary database instance is higher than the replication process or replica infrastructure is able to match. This ReplicaLag may grow over time as replication fails to keep pace with the primary database performance.  Finally, the workload may be bursty throughout different periods of the day/month/etc. that result in occasional ReplicaLag to fall behind.  Your team should investigate which possible root cause has contributed to high ReplicaLag for the database, and possibly change the database instance type or other characteristics of the workload to ensure data continuity on the replica matches your requirements.

Amazon RDS innodb_stats_persistent parameter is turned off,"Description: Your DB instance isn't configured to persist the InnoDB statistics to the disk. When the statistics aren't stored, they are recalculated each time the instance restarts and the table accessed. This leads to variations in the query execution plan. You can modify the value of this global parameter at the table level.


We recommend that you set the innodb_stats_persistent parameter value to ON.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have optimizer statistics that aren't persisted to the disk

Recommended Action
Set the innodb_stats_persistent parameter value to ON

Additional Resources

If the innodb_stats_persistent parameter is set to ON, the optimizer statistics are persisted when the instance restarts. This improves the execution plan stability and consistent query performance. You can modify global statistics persistence at the table level by using the clause STATS_PERSISTENT when you create or alter a table.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: ``Best practices for configuring performance parameters for Amazon RDS for MySQL`"
Amazon RDS sync_binlog parameter is turned off,"Description: The synchronization of the binary log to disk isn't enforced before the transaction commits are acknowledged in your DB instance.


We recommend that you set the sync_binlog parameter value to 1.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have synchronous binary logging turned off

Recommended Action
Set the sync_binlog parameter to 1

Additional Resources

The sync_binlog parameter controls how MySQL pushes the binary log to disk.When the value of this parameter is set to 1, it turns on binary log synchronization to disk before transactions are committed. When the value of this parameter is set to 0, it turns off the binary log synchronization to the disk.Typically, MySQL server depends on the operating system to push the binary log to disk regularly similar to other files. The sync_binlog parameter value set to 0 can enhance the performance. However, during a power failure or an operating system crash, the server loses all the committed transactions that weren't synchronized to the binary logs.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: ``Best practices for configuring replication parameters for Amazon RDS for MySQL`"
Amazon RDS innodb_flush_log_at_trx parameter is turned off,"Description: The value of the innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit parameter of your DB instance isn't safe value. This parameter controls the persistence of commit operations to disk.


We recommend that you set the innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit parameter to 1.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to other than 1

Recommended Action
Set the innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit parameter value to 1

Additional Resources

The database transaction is durable when the log buffer is saved to the durable storage. However, saving to the disk impacts performance. Depending on the value set for innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit parameter, the behavior of how logs are written and saved to the disk can vary.1. When the parameter value is 1, the logs are written and saved to the disk after each committed transaction.2. When the parameter value is 0, the logs are written and saved to the disk once per second.3. When the parameter value is 2, the logs are written after each transaction is committed and saved to the disk once per second. The data moves from the InnoDB memory buffer to the operating system's cache which is also in the memory.Note: When the parameter value is not 1, InnoDB doesn't assure ACID properties. The recent transactions for the last second may be lost when the database crashes.

Amazon MemoryDB Multi-AZ clusters,"Description: Checks for MemoryDB clusters that deploy in a single Availability Zone (AZ). This check alerts you if Multi-AZ is inactive in a cluster.

Deployments in multiple AZs enhance MemoryDB cluster availability by asynchronously replicating to read-only replicas in a different AZ. When planned cluster maintenance occurs, or a primary node is unavailable, MemoryDB automatically promotes a replica to primary. This failover allows cluster write operations to resume, and doesn't require an administrator to intervene.

Alert Criteria
Green: Multi-AZ is active in the cluster.
Yellow: Multi-AZ is inactive in the cluster.

Recommended Action
Create at least one replica per shard, in an AZ that is different than the primary.

Additional Information
For more information, see Minimizing downtime in MemoryDB with Multi-AZ."
Amazon RDS innodb_default_row_format parameter setting is unsafe,"Description: Your DB instance encounters a known issue: A table created in a MySQL version lower than 8.0.26 with the row_format set to COMPACT or REDUNDANT will be inaccessible and unrecoverable when the index exceeds 767 bytes.


We recommend that you set the innodb_default_row_format parameter value to DYNAMIC.

Alert Criteria
Red: DB parameter groups have an unsafe setting for the innodb_default_row_format parameter

Recommended Action
Set the innodb_default_row_format parameter to DYNAMIC

Additional Resources

When a table is created with MySQL version lower than 8.0.26 with row_format COMPACT or REDUNDANT, creating indexes with a key prefix shorter than 767 bytes isn't enforced. After the database restarts, these tables can't be accessed or recovered.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: `Changes in MySQL 8.0.26"
Amazon RDS Read Replicas are open in writable mode,"Description: Your DB instance has a read replica in writable mode, which allows updates from clients.


We recommend that you set the the read_only parameter to TrueIfReplica so that the read replicas isn't in writable mode.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups turn on writable mode for the read replicas

Recommended Action
Set the read_only parameter value to TrueIfReplica

Additional Resources

The read_only parameter controls the write permission from the clients to a database instance. The default value for this parameter is TrueIfReplica. For a replica instance, TrueIfReplica sets the read_only value to ON (1) and disables any write activity from the clients. For a master/writer instance, TrueIfReplica sets the value to OFF (0) and enables the write activity from the clients for the instance.When the read replica is opened in writable mode, the data stored in this instance may diverge from the primary instance which causes replication errors.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: ``Best practices for configuring replication parameters for Amazon RDS for MySQL`"
Amazon RDS max_user_connections parameter is low,"Description: Your DB instance has a low value for the maximum number of simultaneous connections for each database account.


We recommend setting the max_user_connections parameter to a number greater than 5.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have max_user_connections misconfigured

Recommended Action
Increase the value of the max_user_connections parameter to a number greater than 5

Additional Resources

The max_user_connections setting controls the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for a MySQL user account. Reaching this connection limit cause failures in the RDS instance administration operations, such as backup, patching, and parameters changes.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: `Setting Account Resource Limits for MySQL"
Amazon RDS innodb_open_files parameter is low,"Description: The innodb_open_files parameter controls the number of files InnoDB can open at one time. InnoDB opens all of the log and system tablespace files when mysqld is running.


Your DB instance has a low value for the maximum number of files InnoDB can open at one time. We recommend that you set the innodb_open_files parameter to a minimum value of 65.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have the InnoDB open files setting misconfigured

Recommended Action
Set the innodb_open_files parameter to a minimum value of 65

Additional Resources

The innodb_open_files parameter controls the number of files InnoDB can open at one time. InnoDB keeps all the log files and the system tablespace files open when mysqld is running. InnoDB also needs to open a few .ibd files, if file-per-table storage model is used. When the innodb_open_files setting is low, it impacts the database performance and the server may fail to start.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: `InnoDB open files for MySQL"
Amazon EC2 to EBS Throughput Optimization,"Description: Checks for Amazon EBS volumes whose performance might be affected by the maximum throughput capability of the Amazon EC2 instance they are attached to. To optimize performance, you should ensure that the maximum throughput of an EC2 instance is greater than the aggregate maximum throughput of the attached EBS volumes. This check computes the total EBS volume throughput for each five-minute period in the preceding day (UTC) for each EBS-optimized instance and alerts you if usage in more than half of those periods was greater than 95% of the maximum throughput of the EC2 instance.

 Alert Criteria
 Yellow: In the preceding day (UTC), the aggregate throughput (megabytes/sec) of the EBS volumes attached to the EC2 instance exceeded 95% of the published throughput between the instance and the EBS volumes more than 50% of time.

 Recommended Action
 Compare the maximum throughput of your EBS volumes (see Amazon EBS Volume Types) with the maximum throughput of the EC2 instance they are attached to (see Instance Types That Support EBS Optimization). Consider attaching your volumes to an instance that supports higher throughput to EBS for optimal performance.

Amazon RDS instance under-provisioned for system capacity,"Description: Checks whether Amazon RDS instance or Amazon Aurora DB instance has the required system capacity to operate.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: 

Out-of-memory kills: When a process on the database host is stopped because of memory reduction at the OS level, the Out Of Memory (OOM) kills counter increases.

Excessive swapping:  os.memory.swap.in and os.memory.swap.out metric values were high.

Recommended Action
We recommend that you tune your queries to use less memory or use a DB instance type with higher allocated memory. When the instance is running low on memory, this impacts the database performance.

Additional Resources
Out-of-memory kills were detected:Linux kernel invokes the Out of Memory (OOM) Killer when the processes running on the host require more than the memory physically available from the operating system. In this case, the OOM Killer reviews all the running processes, and stops one or more processes, in order to free up system memory and keep the system running.Swapping is detected:When the memory isn't sufficient on the database host, the operating system sends a few minimum used pages to the disk in the swap space. This offloading process impacts the database performance.For more information, see Amazon RDS Instance Types and Scaling your Amazon RDS instance   
"
Amazon Aurora DB cluster under-provisioned for read workload,"Description: Checks whether Amazon Aurora DB cluster has the resources to support a read workload.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: 

Increased database reads: The database load was high and the database was reading more rows than writing or updating the rows.

Recommended Action
We recommend that you tune your queries to decrease the database load or add a reader DB instance to your DB cluster with the same instance class and size as the writer DB instance in the cluster. The current configuration has at least one DB instance with a continuously high database load caused mostly by read operations. Distribute these operations by adding another DB instance to the cluster and directing the read workload to the DB cluster read-only endpoint.

Additional Resources
An Aurora DB cluster has one reader endpoint for read-only connections. This endpoint uses load balancing to manage the queries contributing the most to database load in your DB cluster. The reader endpoint directs these statements to the Aurora Read Replicas and reduces the load on the primary instance. The reader endpoint also scales the capacity to handle concurrent SELECT queries with the number of Aurora Read Replicas in the cluster.For more information, see Adding Aurora Replicas to a DB Cluster and Managing performance and scaling for Aurora DB clusters

Alert Criteria
Yellow: DB parameter groups have general_logging turned on

Recommended Action
Check your requirements for general logging usage. If it isn't mandatory, we recommend that you to set the general_logging parameter value to 0.

Additional Resources

The general query log is turned on when the general_log parameter value is 1. The general query log contains records of the database server operations. The server writes information to this log when clients connect or disconnect and the logs contain each SQL statement received from the clients. The general query log is useful when you suspect an error in a client and you want to find the information the client to sent to the database server.

For more information, please refer to the AWS Public documentation on: `Overview of RDS for MySQL database logs"
Amazon Route 53 Latency Resource Record Sets,"Description: Checks for Amazon Route 53 latency record sets that are configured inefficiently. To allow Amazon Route 53 to route queries to the region with the lowest network latency, you should create latency resource record sets for a particular domain name (such as example.com) in different regions. If you create only one latency resource record set for a domain name, all queries are routed to one region, and you pay extra for latency-based routing without getting the benefits. Hosted zones created by AWS services won’t appear in your check results.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: Only one latency resource record set is configured for a particular domain name.

Recommended Action
If you have resources in multiple regions, be sure to define a latency resource record set for each region; see Latency-Based Routing.
If you have resources in only one region, consider creating resources in more than one region and define latency resource record sets for each; see Latency-Based Routing.

IAM Password Policy,"Description: Checks the password policy for your account and warns when a password policy is not enabled, or if password content requirements have not been enabled. Password content requirements increase the overall security of your AWS environment by enforcing the creation of strong user passwords. When you create or change a password policy, the change is enforced immediately for new users but does not require existing users to change their passwords. 

Alert Criteria
Green: A password policy is enabled with recommended content requirement enabled.
Yellow: A password policy is enabled, but at least one content requirement is not enabled.  
Red: No password policy is enabled. 

Recommended Action
If some content requirements are not enabled, consider enabling them. If no password policy is enabled, create and configure one. See Setting an Account Password Policy for IAM Users.
To access the AWS Management Console, IAM users need passwords. As a best practice, AWS highly recommends that instead of creating IAM users, you use federation. Federation allows users to use their existing corporate credentials to log into the AWS Management Console. Use AWS IAM Identity Center to create or federate the user, and then assume an IAM role into an account.

AWS Lambda Functions with High Error Rates,"Description: Checks for Lambda functions with high error rates that may result in high cost. Lambda charges based on the number of requests and aggregate execution time for your function. Function errors may cause retries that incur additional charges.
Note: Results for this check are automatically refreshed several times daily, and refresh requests are not allowed. It might take a few hours for changes to appear.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: Functions where > 10% of invocations end in error on any given day within the last 7 days.

Recommended Action
Consider the following guidelines to reduce errors. Function errors include errors returned by the function's code and errors returned by the function's runtime. To help you troubleshoot Lambda errors, Lambda integrates with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. You can use a combination of logs, metrics, alarms, and X-ray tracing to quickly detect and identify issues in your function code, API, or other resources that support your application. For more information, see Monitoring and troubleshooting Lambda applications. For more information on handling errors with specific runtimes, see Error handling and automatic retries in AWS Lambda.

IAM Access Key Rotation,"Description: Checks for active IAM access keys that have not been rotated in the last 90 days.  When you rotate your access keys regularly, you reduce the chance that a compromised key could be used without your knowledge to access resources. For the purposes of this check, the last rotation date and time is when the access key was created or most recently activated. The access key number and date come from the access_key_1_last_rotated and access_key_2_last_rotated information in the most recent IAM credential report. Because the regeneration frequency of a credential report  is restricted, refreshing this check might not reflect recent changes (for details, see Getting Credential Reports for Your AWS Account).
In order to create and rotate access keys, a user must have the appropriate permissions. For more information, see Allow Users to Manage Their Own Passwords, Access Keys, and SSH Keys.

Alert Criteria
Green: The access key is active and has been rotated in the last 90 days.
Yellow: The access key is active and has been rotated in the last 2 years, but more than 90 days ago.
Red: The access key is active and has not been rotated in the last 2 years.

Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted,"Description: Checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to specific ports. Unrestricted access increases opportunities for malicious activity (hacking, denial-of-service attacks, loss of data). The ports with highest risk are flagged red, and those with less risk are flagged yellow. Ports flagged green are typically used by applications that require unrestricted access, such as HTTP and SMTP.
If you have intentionally configured your security groups in this manner, we recommend using additional security measures to secure your infrastructure (such as IP tables).

Note: This check only evaluates security groups that you create and their inbound rules for IPv4 addresses. Security groups created by AWS Directory Services are flagged as red or yellow, but they don’t pose a security risk and can be safely ignored or excluded. For more information, see the Trusted Advisor FAQ.

Note: This check does not include the use case when a customer managed prefix list grants access to 0.0.0.0/0 and is used as a source with a security group.

Alert Criteria
Green: Access to port 80, 25, 443, or 465 is unrestricted.
Red: Access to port 20, 21, 1433, 1434, 3306, 3389, 4333, 5432, or 5500 is unrestricted.
Yellow: Access to any other port is unrestricted.

Recommended Action
Restrict access to only those IP addresses that require it. To restrict access to a specific IP address, set the suffix to /32 (for example, 192.0.2.10/32). Be sure to delete overly permissive rules after creating rules that are more restrictive.

Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions,"Description: Checks buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) that have open access permissions or allow access to any authenticated AWS user. Bucket permissions that grant List access can result in higher than expected charges if objects in the bucket are listed by unintended users at a high frequency. Bucket permissions that grant Upload/Delete access create potential security vulnerabilities by allowing users that to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: The bucket ACL allows List access for ""Everyone"" or ""Any Authenticated AWS User"".
Yellow: A bucket policy allows any kind of open access.
Yellow: Bucket policy has statements that grant public access. The “Block public and cross-account access to buckets that have public policies” setting is turned on and has restricted access to only authorized users of that account until public statements are removed.
Yellow: Trusted Advisor does not have permission to check the policy, or the policy could not be evaluated for other reasons.
Red: The bucket ACL allows Upload/Delete access for ""Everyone"" or ""Any Authenticated AWS User"".
Green: All S3 buckets are compliant based on the ACL and/or bucket policy.

Recommended Action
If a bucket allows open access, determine if open access is truly needed. For example to host a static website, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve the content hosted on Amazon S3. See Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin in the CloudFront Developer Guide. When possible, update the bucket permissions to restrict access to the owner or specific users. Use Amazon S3 Block Public Access to control the settings that allow public access to your data. See Setting Bucket and Object Access Permissions.

Amazon Route 53 mismatching CNAME records pointing directly to S3 buckets,"Description: Checks the Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones with CNAME records pointing directly to Amazon S3 bucket hostnames and alerts if your CNAME does not match with your S3 bucket name.

Alert Criteria
Red: Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone has CNAME records pointing to mismatching S3 bucket hostnames.
Green: No mismatching CNAME records found in your Amazon Route53 Hosted Zone.

Recommended Action
When pointing CNAME records to S3 bucket hostnames, you need to ensure that a matching bucket exists for any CNAME or alias record you configure. By doing this, you can avoid the risk of your CNAME records being spoofed and prevent any unauthorized AWS user from hosting faulty or malicous web content with your domain.

You could also consider to avoid pointing CNAME records directly to S3 bucket hostnames and instead start using origin access control (OAC) to access your S3 bucket web assets through Amazon CloudFront.

Refer here to more information about associating CNAME with an Amazon S3 bucket hostname.

Amazon S3 Server Access Logs Enabled,"Description: Checks the logging configuration of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.
When server access logging is enabled, detailed access logs are delivered hourly to a bucket that you choose. An access log record contains details about each request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request, and the time and date the request was processed. By default, bucket logging is not enabled. You should enable logging if you want to perform security audits or learn more about users and usage patterns.
When logging is initially enabled, the configuration is automatically validated. However, future modifications can result in logging failures. This check examines explicit Amazon S3 bucket permissions. It's best practice to use bucket policies for controlling bucket permissions, however ACLs can be used as well.
Alert CriteriaYellow: The bucket does not have server access logging enabled.Yellow: The target bucket permissions do not include the root account, so Trusted Advisor cannot check it.Red: The target bucket does not exist.Red: The target bucket and the source bucket have different owners.Red: The log deliverer does not have write permissions for the target bucket.Green: Bucket has server access logging enabled, the target exists, and permissions to write to target exists
Recommended ActionEnable bucket logging for most buckets. See Enabling Logging Using the Console and Enabling Logging Programmatically.
If the target bucket permissions do not include the root account and you want Trusted Advisor to check the logging status, add the root account as a grantee. See Editing Bucket Permissions.
If the target bucket does not exist, select an existing bucket as a target or create a new one and select it. See Managing Bucket Logging.
If the target and source have different owners, change the target bucket to one that has the same owner as the source bucket. See Managing Bucket Logging.
If the log deliverer does not have write permissions for the target (Write not enabled), grant Upload/Delete permissions to the Log Delivery group. Using bucket policies over ACLs is recommended. See Editing Bucket Permissions. and Permissions for Log Delivery.

S3 Incomplete Multipart Upload Abort Configuration,"Description: Checks that each S3 bucket is configured with a lifecycle rule to abort multipart uploads that remain incomplete after 7 days. Using a lifecycle rule to abort these incomplete uploads and delete the associated storage is recommended.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: The lifecycle configuration bucket does not contain a lifecycle rule to abort all multipart uploads that remain incomplete after 7 days.

Recommended Action
Review lifecycle configuration for buckets without a lifecycle rule that would cleanup all incomplete multipart uploads. Uploads that are not completed after 24 hours are unlikely to be completed. Click here to follow instructions to create a lifecycle rule. It is recommended that this is applied to all objects in your bucket. If you have a need to apply other lifecycle actions to selected objects in your bucket, you can have multiple rules with different filters.

Amazon EC2 Availability Zone Balance,"Description: Checks the distribution of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances across Availability Zones in a region. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are designed to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and to provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same region. By launching instances in multiple Availability Zones in the same region, you can help protect your applications from a single point of failure.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: The region has instances in multiple zones, but the distribution is uneven (the difference between the highest and lowest instance counts in utilized Availability Zones is greater than 20%).
Red: The region has instances only in a single Availability Zone.

Recommended Action

Exposed access keys pose a security risk to your account and other users, could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity or abuse, and violate the AWS Customer Agreement. If your access key is exposed, take immediate action to secure your account. To protect your account from excessive charges, AWS temporarily limits your ability to create certain AWS resources when exposed access keys are identified. This does not make your account secure; it only partially limits the unauthorized usage for which you could be charged. Note: This check does not guarantee the identification of exposed access keys or compromised EC2 instances. You are ultimately responsible for the safety and security of your access keys and AWS resources.   

If a deadline is shown for an access key, AWS may suspend your AWS account if the unauthorized usage is not stopped by that date. If you believe an alert is in error, contact AWS Support.

The information displayed in Trusted Advisor may not reflect the most recent state of your account. No exposed access keys are marked as resolved until all exposed access keys on the account have been resolved. This data synchronization can take up to one week.

Alert Criteria
Red: Potentially compromised - AWS has identified an access key ID and corresponding secret access key that have been exposed on the Internet and may have been compromised (used).
Red: Exposed - AWS has identified an access key ID and corresponding secret access key that have been exposed on the Internet.
Red: Suspected - Irregular Amazon EC2 usage indicates that an access key may have been compromised, but it has not been identified as exposed on the Internet.

Recommended Action
Delete the affected access key as soon as possible. If the key is associated with an IAM user, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users.

Check your account for unauthorized usage. Log in to the AWS Management Console and check each service console for suspicious resources. Pay special attention to running Amazon EC2 instances, Spot Instance requests, access keys, and IAM users. You can also check overall usage on the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard.

Auto Scaling Group Resources,"Description: Checks the availability of resources associated with launch configurations and your Auto Scaling groups. Auto Scaling groups that point to unavailable resources cannot launch new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. When properly configured, Auto Scaling causes the number of Amazon EC2 instances to increase seamlessly during demand spikes and decrease automatically during demand lulls. Auto Scaling groups and launch configurations that point to unavailable resources do not operate as intended.

Alert Criteria
Red: An Auto Scaling group is associated with a deleted load balancer.
Red: A launch configuration is associated with a deleted Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Recommended Action
If the load balancer has been deleted, either create a new load balancer or target group then associate it to the Auto Scaling group, or create a new Auto Scaling group without the load balancer. For information about creating a new Auto Scaling group with a new load balancer, see Set Up an Auto-Scaled and Load-Balanced Application. For information about creating a new Auto Scaling group without a load balancer, see ""Create Auto Scaling Group"" in Getting Started With Auto Scaling Using the Console.
If the AMI has been deleted, create a new launch template or launch template version using a valid AMI and associate it with an Auto Scaling group. See ""Create Launch Configuration"" in Getting Started With Auto Scaling Using the Console.

Amazon S3 Bucket Logging,"Description: Checks the logging configuration of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. When server access logging is enabled, detailed access logs are delivered hourly to a bucket that you choose. An access log record contains details about each request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request, and the time and date the request was processed. By default, bucket logging is not enabled; you should enable logging if you want to perform security audits or learn more about users and usage patterns.

When logging is initially enabled, the configuration is automatically validated; however, future modifications can result in logging failures. This check examines explicit Amazon S3 bucket permissions, but it does not examine associated bucket policies that might override the bucket permissions.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: The bucket does not have server access logging enabled.
Yellow: The target bucket permissions do not include the root account, so Trusted Advisor cannot check it.
Red: The target bucket does not exist.
Red: The target bucket and the source bucket have different owners.
Red: The log deliverer does not have write permissions for the target bucket.

Recommended Action
Enable bucket logging for most buckets. See Enabling Logging Using the Console and Enabling Logging Programmatically. 
If the target bucket permissions do not include the root account and you want Trusted Advisor to check the logging status, add the root account as a grantee. See Editing Bucket Permissions.
If the target bucket does not exist, select an existing bucket as a target or create a new one and select it. See Managing Bucket Logging.
If the target and source have different owners, change the target bucket to one that has the same owner as the source bucket. See Managing Bucket Logging.
If the log deliverer does not have write permissions for the target (Write not enabled), grant Upload/Delete permissions to the Log Delivery group. See Editing Bucket Permissions.

CloudFront Header Forwarding and Cache Hit Ratio,"Description: Checks the HTTP request headers that CloudFront currently receives from the client and forwards to your origin server. Some headers, such as Date or User-Agent, significantly reduce the cache hit ratio (the proportion of requests that are served from a CloudFront edge cache). This increases the load on your origin and reduces performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to your origin.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: One or more request headers that CloudFront forwards to your origin might significantly reduce your cache hit ratio.

Recommended Action
Consider whether the request headers provide enough benefit to justify the negative effect on the cache hit ratio. If your origin returns the same object regardless of the value of a given header, we recommend that you don't configure CloudFront to forward that header to the origin. For more information, see Configuring CloudFront to Cache Objects Based on Request Headers.

Load Balancer Optimization,"Description: Checks your load balancer configuration. To help increase the level of fault tolerance in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) when using Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend running an equal number of instances across multiple Availability Zones in a region. A load balancer that is configured accrues charges, so this is a cost-optimization check as well.

Alert Criteria
Yellow: A load balancer is enabled for a single Availability Zone.
Yellow: A load balancer is enabled for an Availability Zone that has no active instances.
Yellow: The Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with a load balancer are unevenly distributed across Availability Zones. (The difference between the highest and lowest instance counts in utilized Availability Zones is more than 1, and the difference is more than 20% of the highest count.)

Recommended Action
Ensure that your load balancer points to active and healthy instances in at least two Availability Zones. For more information, see Add Availability Zone.
If your load balancer is configured for an Availability Zone with no healthy instances, or if there is an imbalance of instances across the Availability Zones, determine if all the Availability Zones are necessary. Omit any unnecessary Availability Zones and ensure there is a balanced distribution of instances across the remaining Availability Zones. For more information, see Remove Availability Zone.
