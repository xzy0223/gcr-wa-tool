Security,SEC 1 How do you securely operate your workload?,P0 Secure account root user and properties,MFA on Root Account,"Description: Checks the root account and warns if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enabled. For increased security, we recommend that you protect your account by using MFA, which requires a user to enter a unique authentication code from their MFA hardware or virtual device when interacting with the AWS console and associated websites.		Note		For your AWS Organization management account, AWS requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user when accessing the AWS Console.		For your AWS Organizations member accounts, AWS recommends the use of MFA. Also, you can use an AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP) to effectively block all root actions. For more information, please see Best practices for member accounts in AWS Organizations User Guide.				Alert Criteria		Red: MFA is not enabled on the root account.				Recommended Action		Log in to your root account and activate an MFA device. See Checking MFA Status and Setting Up an MFA Device.		You can enable MFA on your account at any time by visiting the ""Security Credentials"" page, which is available in the top right account menu drop-down in the AWS Management Console. We support multiple industry standard forms of MFA, such as FIDO2 and virtual authenticators, to give you flexibility to choose a MFA device that meets your needs. We also recommend that you register more than one MFA device for resiliency, in the event one of your MFA devices is lost or stops working.				Additional Resources		Please refer to General steps for enabling MFA devices and Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console) in our AWS IAM User Guide for additional information."
Security,SEC 1 How do you securely operate your workload?,P0 Secure account root user and properties,IAM Password Policy,"Description: Checks the password policy for your account and warns when a password policy is not enabled, or if password content requirements have not been enabled. Password content requirements increase the overall security of your AWS environment by enforcing the creation of strong user passwords. When you create or change a password policy, the change is enforced immediately for new users but does not require existing users to change their passwords. 				Alert Criteria		Green: A password policy is enabled with recommended content requirement enabled.		Yellow: A password policy is enabled, but at least one content requirement is not enabled.  		Red: No password policy is enabled. 				Recommended Action		If some content requirements are not enabled, consider enabling them. If no password policy is enabled, create and configure one. See Setting an Account Password Policy for IAM Users.		To access the AWS Management Console, IAM users need passwords. As a best practice, AWS highly recommends that instead of creating IAM users, you use federation. Federation allows users to use their existing corporate credentials to log into the AWS Management Console. Use AWS IAM Identity Center to create or federate the user, and then assume an IAM role into an account.

When versioning is enabled, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore any version of any object stored in a bucket. You can use lifecycle rules to manage all versions of your objects as well as their associated costs by automatically archiving objects to the Glacier storage class or removing them after a specified time period. You can also choose to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for any object deletions or configuration changes to your buckets. 				Versioning cannot be disabled after it has been enabled, but it can be suspended, which prevents new versions of objects from being created. Using versioning can increase your costs for Amazon S3, because you pay for storage of multiple versions of an object.				Alert Criteria		Green: Versioning is enabled for the bucket.		Yellow: Versioning is not enabled for the bucket.		Yellow: Versioning is suspended for the bucket.				Recommended Action		Enable bucket versioning on most buckets to prevent accidental deletion or overwriting. See Using Versioning and Enabling Versioning Programmatically. 				If bucket versioning is suspended, consider reenabling versioning. For information on working with objects in a versioning-suspended bucket, see Managing Objects in a Versioning-Suspended Bucket.				When versioning is enabled or suspended, you can define lifecycle configuration rules to mark certain object versions as expired or to permanently remove unneeded object versions. For more information, see Object Lifecycle Management. 				MFA Delete requires additional authentication when the versioning status of the bucket is changed or when versions of an object are deleted.
